<h2>Our Current Focus</h2>
<br>
Since 2017, Chicago Chapter Charities Foundation has strategically targeted its philanthropic focus to the critical issue of mental health and wellness in the African American community. 
Our support focuses on:<br>
1) awareness and education
2) collaboration with NAMI-Chicago and faith-based organizations
3) mental health and wellness intervention, and 
4) advocacy about disparities. 
<br>
Between 2017 and 2020, CCCF granted over $200,000 toward improving African American mental health in Chicago.
