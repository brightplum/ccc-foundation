<h2>Our History</h2>
<br>
CCCF was founded November 3, 1988 as the Chicago Links Foundation to provide structure to the fundraising efforts of a well-established African American professional women’s service organization in Chicago. 
The name was changed in 1994 to Chicago Cotillion Charities Foundation, and again in 2017 to Chicago Chapter Charities Foundation, to capture the growing breadth of the foundation’s fundraising and philanthropy. 
Historically, the foundation generated funds through the annual Debutante Cotillion program, a highly successful fundraiser and teen mentoring program. 
Today, the foundation generates funds via the highly regarded, annual Power & Purpose Chicago luncheon program, which brings together civic-minded Chicagoans to collectively activate around critical issues and recognize grassroots non-profits addressing those issues. 
The foundation operates with a board of directors and officers. 
It operates exclusively for charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
