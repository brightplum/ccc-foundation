<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
<br>
Chicago Chapter Charities Foundation is a registered 501(c) 3 public charitable organization formed in 1988. 
The mission of the Chicago Chapter Charities Foundation (CCCF) is to positively impact the lives of African Americans in Chicago. 
Through our philanthropic support, we provide financial resources to non-profit organizations. 
CCCF also supports the community service initiatives of The Links, Inc. 
We generate philanthropic funds through signature fundraising programs and general fund development.

<h2>Our History</h2>
<br>
CCCF was founded November 3, 1988 as the Chicago Links Foundation to provide structure to the fundraising efforts of a well-established African American professional women’s service organization in Chicago. 
The name was changed in 1994 to Chicago Cotillion Charities Foundation, and again in 2017 to Chicago Chapter Charities Foundation, to capture the growing breadth of the foundation’s fundraising and philanthropy. 
Historically, the foundation generated funds through the annual Debutante Cotillion program, a highly successful fundraiser and teen mentoring program. 
Today, the foundation generates funds via the highly regarded, annual Power & Purpose Chicago luncheon program, which brings together civic-minded Chicagoans to collectively activate around critical issues and recognize grassroots non-profits addressing those issues. 
The foundation operates with a board of directors and officers. 
It operates exclusively for charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
