<h1>Power & Purpose</h1>
<br>
Power & Purpose Chicago
is a Fundraiser Luncheon
presented by Chicago Chapter
Charities Foundation (CCCF)
to
raise awareness, recognize, and support
organizations that are working to
improve the mental health of those who live in
neighborhoods most impacted
by the gun
violence in
the City of Chicago.


<br>
<br>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<br>
Our goal is to bring philanthropic, corporate and civic leaders and the
community together to increase awareness of the effects of gun violence on
mental health, and its ultimate effect on families and communities. Together,
we want to harness the collective power and purpose of our guests in action to
create and promote change.
